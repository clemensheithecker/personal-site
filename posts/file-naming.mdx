# File Naming And Folder Structure

Keep your file system accessible and maintainable by following these guidelines when naming your files and folders:

- Keep everything lowercase.
- Don’t use spaces.
- Instead, use hyphens (-) to separate words.
- Only use [standard ASCII alphanumeric characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) (a-z and 0-9).
- Keep names to a maximum of 35 characters.
- When using sequential numbers, keep the number of digits consistent (e.g. `note-01.md`, … , `note-10.md`).
- Don’t use generic file names such as `document1.pdf`.
- Use the [international standard date notation ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (`YYYY-MM-DD`) if applicable.
- When dealing with multiple versions, add `-v01`, `-v02`, etc. to the end of the file name.
- And most importantly, stay consistent!

A few examples of short yet descriptive and organized file names:

- `labor-lecture-1-notes.md`
- `practicum-2022-03-01-meeting-notes.pdf`
- `thesis-presentation-v01.pptx`
- `resume-2022-02-18-v01.docx`

## Folder Structure

When organizing your files in folders (or directories), consider these principles:

- Limit the level of nesting.
- Limit the repetition of information in file and folder names.
- Consider using common or easy-to-understand abbreviations when referring to long projects or locations.
- Structure your file system so anyone could follow it easily. Keep it simple!
- Again, stay consistent!

An example of a simple, easy to follow folder structure:

```
.
└── bachelor-economics/
    ├── semester-6-experimental-behavioral/
    │   ├── exp-behav-lecture-1.pdf
    │   └── exp-behav-lecture-2-notes.pdf
    └── semester-6-labor-economics/
        └── labor-lectures/
            ├── labor-lecture-1.pdf
            ├── labor-lecture-1-notes.pdf
            └── labor-lecture-2.pdf
```
