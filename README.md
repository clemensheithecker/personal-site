# Clemens Heithecker's Personal Website

The code to my personal website [clemensheithecker.com](https://clemensheithecker.com). The app is a place to showcase my work as much as it is a portfolio item in itself. In this project, I apply my self-taught web-development skills starting with *HTML*, *CSS*, and *JavaScript* as well as higher-level frameworks such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

## Features

The core features of the app include:

- Responsive, mobile-first user interface.
- MDX-based portfolio and blog using data fetching.
- Re-routing for URL shortening (e.g. [clemensheithecker.com/linkedin](https://clemensheithecker.com/linkedin) to [linkedin.com/in/clemensheithecker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clemensheithecker)).
- Multiple color schemes (light and dark mode).
- Custom animations and transitions.
