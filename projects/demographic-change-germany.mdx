# Demographic Change in Germany—A Data Visualization Case Study

A low birth rate and rising life expectancy are fueling demographic change in Germany. These trends pose economic challenges such as a dwindling labor force and the underfunding of social security systems. As a result, lawmakers must re-evaluate existing public policies and design new solutions. This case study provides data visualizations supporting the exploration and evaluation of policy options to solve these demographic problems.

## Visualizations

A visualization of the average live births per woman over time. The data is grouped by region: Federal Republic of Germany, former territory of the Federal Republic, former territory of East Germany. The data shows a declining birth rate in the mid and late 20th century, followed by a period of stagnation in most of Germany, and a continued decline in recent years.

A visual comparison of the at-risk-of-poverty rate by household type. The rate is measured against the federal median income. Having many children and raising children alone significantly increases a family's risk of poverty.

A map visualization to compare the total fertility rates between countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association. Germany's fertility rate lies below the European average.
